===========

Flask app for charting my mapmyrun data with d3js
-----------

I'm using the mapmyrun API to pull down my workout data and graph it all nice like. Charts built with d3.

I've got a lot I'd like to add here, including individual workout breakdowns and also caching. Right now it pulls
directly from the api, although I'd like to save everything to a db at somepoint.
